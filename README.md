# 300-Plus-Songs

This plugin allows up to 2000 songs to be added in MM+. It updates the save data file, so ur save data will reset. However, it saves in a folder called DIVA instead of SEGA, so u can revert to ur old save data at anytime, as long as ur not using a mod with over 300 songs. Sigscanning is impossible for this patch, so itll have to be updated every time theres a new game update. Leaderboard is also disabled for obvious reasons

Known bug: Autosave is disabled by default for some reason, so ull have to enable it manually.
